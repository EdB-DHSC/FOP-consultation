It is also not clear when a certain macro nutrient becomes a different colour. How many grams is yellow or red? Additionally, will it be green or yellow if it only contains a couple of grams of sugar but in a very small portion? It should be more clear when something is definitely not healthy. Even if something contains a small amount of an unhealthy nutrient, but would be a lot in a large quantity, colours should reflect that. No one eats two biscuits.

I also feel the system is too confusing for non-professionals, lower socio-economic group, BAMEs to fully understand.  All figures and % have to be removed...how can someone add up % of one food with anothers they may consume in one day?  Pointless.  The only that is meaningful to consumers is the colour coding.",No,No,Difficult,Very easy,Difficult,Moderate,Remove all figures & %. Just have colour coding and make it mandatory across all manufacturers as many manufacturers with HFSS products purposefully use the FOPNL without the MTL.  As well as adjusting the colour coding for portions over 100g/ml there shoudl also be allowances for portions way below 100g e.g. breakfast cereals - no one ever consumes anywhere near 100g yet it is colour coded on the same basis as a cream cake portion.,Yes,,,Yes,,Chile,,Like,Like,Like,Like,"Also - exactly the same system as HFSS scoring in the UK - so we could easily adopt for labelling. Dubious that any labelling changes will have any significant impact on consumers.  It places responsibility on the individual again - how many years have we put the choice in consumer hands and educated++++ with the result of progressively unhealthy habits.  ENVIRONMENT HAS TO CHANGE - HEALTHIER CHOICES NEED TO BE MADE EASILY ACCESSIBLE and unhealthy choices need to be minimised - significantly.  Especially for deprived areas where the majority of retail shelves display HFSS products and they are surrounding by HFSS style take-aways.  Also to assess true impact/success - can we monitor the long term impact of real life choices once in place and not rely on short-term studies which places consumers under artificial environments.  Additionally, should we not focus on population groups who desperately need assistance vs those who are already following healthier eating patterns. If the Nutri-Score is used in line with more RADICAL and serious 'nudging' / environment improvements, then it's better than our current FOPNL MTL model - simple and easy to understand. Also the model has also started to include 'healthy fats' within its positive score. Problem - again based on per 100g - it would be good if it can be adapted to accommodate for standard portions.  Even though portions vary - there are standards - PHE is setting standard portions for it's obesity strategy. Positive nutrients - could this be adapted to add in % DRVs of vits and mins? Or key nutrient the nation needs to eat more of e.g. fibre, iron etc. Negative nutrients - relate to UK DRVs vs EU standards. Can we add on to the score - a portion pack score i.e. if the product is not packaged as single portion - if it's a share pack which encourages over consumtption. ",I do not have a view,Like,Like,As above and as Chile did - will only be successful if other healthy eating policies are in place. The government needs to radically change the food environment we all live in.    This is simple and I think simple is all that consumers can truly understand.  Same issues as above re per 100g.,No,,No,,,Can we introduce sustainable factors also within the score systems?  This is as important.,Improve the food environment - stop manipulating the food manufacture and start focusing on changing the balance of healthier foods and drinks vs unhealthy on the shelves of retailers.,,Yes,Any values used should reflect UK DRVs vs European.,Yes,It needs to be made relevant to the UK population.  EU regs for making rich in fibre is laughable especially as one can also claim 'rich in fibre' if they provide at least 3g pre 100kcal as well as 6g per 100g ... thus products providing significant quantities of fibre in a standard serving e.g. high fibre cereals and products providing 3g per 100kcal) can make the same claim.  And industry uses this to it's advantage!,,Yes,Depends if you go with figures and numbers or just colour coding. Also will have little impact except with the 'fit well' unless it is used in conjunction with a radically changed food environment. It will have to be mandatory across all packaging. Clearly the size of the label will have to larger and easy to decipher for those with visual impairements. How will people be educated? ,I do not know,I do not know,I do not know,,I don't know,,,No,The environment has to change.  The latest sustainable diets publications clearly demonstrate the divide between the most deprived and least deprived - government statistics. Clearly we need to tackle by socioeconomic groups differently.  We cannot put the responsibility on the individual - look at our advice for Eatwell plate and EAtwell guide - in 2012 - ,,,I do not have a view,,No,What evidence do you have to show the impact of FOP NL's impact on consumer choice in the long-term in real life and on obesity?

The system must take into account the nutritional contribution of each food group to the diet.   2. Should support the consumer in improving the nutritional quality of the food basket:  o	Allowing consumers to identify the best nutritional options within sub-categories of products. Therefore, it should be (sub-)category-specific.  o	It should be interpretative, by informing about the overall nutritional quality of a product, instead of evaluating individual nutrients. o	It should offer the opportunity for reformulation to support the consumer in making small steps towards better nutrition.  3. Be a voluntary, harmonized system as much as possible o	Possibly for EU member states, within the EU legal framework. o	Food business operators to decide if they want to put the logo on their products. 4. Be based on sound scientific evidence: o	The scheme should be accompanied by an education program, to explain the scheme to consumers. o	The scheme should be evaluated in order to check consumer understanding and improvement of behaviour.  5.

The system must take into account the nutritional contribution of each food group to the diet.   2. Should support the consumer in improving the nutritional quality of the food basket:  o	Allowing consumers to identify the best nutritional options within sub-categories of products. Therefore, it should be (sub-)category-specific.  o	It should be interpretative, by informing about the overall nutritional quality of a product, instead of evaluating individual nutrients. o	It should offer the opportunity for reformulation to support the consumer in making small steps towards better nutrition.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Antipsychotics Associated with Severe COVID-19 and Fatal Outcomes  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...

This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.

How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Antipsychotics Associated with Severe COVID-19 and Fatal Outcomes  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...

To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Antipsychotics Associated with Severe COVID-19 and Fatal Outcomes  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...

The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)

It was obvious that we needed something new and different and radical, based upon the economic crash of 2008 which affected us quite badly.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Antipsychotics Associated with Severe COVID-19 and Fatal Outcomes  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)

It was obvious that we needed something new and different and radical, based upon the economic crash of 2008 which affected us quite badly.  That wealth extraction, that straight-jacket that we’re in, we want to tackle by offering an alternative…  So, you’re getting that virtual cycle of keeping wealth in the community and democratising the wealth as well, and democratising the economy.  We are actually bringing that democracy back. And let’s compete with the big banks.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Antipsychotics Associated with Severe COVID-19 and Fatal Outcomes  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...

I don't think high and low Glycaemic Index of food is mentioned in labelling but ought to get, if government are trying to reduce incidence of diabetes and obesity.",,Yes,Yes this needs explaining to the public.,Yes,,,Yes,I'd say race could be a factor as cultural differences in how we interpret government guidance come into play.

This would have a positive impact on children regardless of their family's income.",Yes,"I'd like to see pictures of example portion sizes on the back of the packet too e.g. pasta on a plate showing what 40g of cooked pasta looks like or simply the terminology of how much a carbohydrate portion looks like in your hand. For some products you don't need this as the food already comes in the appropriate portion size e.g. one apple, one pot of yoghurt.

An alert would be great because there are products people are used to buying without thinking or knowing that they may not be the best choices.

An alternative way might be to highlight products that are good for you. An example of this is the &#34;Heart symbol - a better choice&#34; that has been applied in Finland since 2000 to products that comply with a defined food-category based criteria for nutrients.  This positive labeling is easy to recognise as a good choice and doesn't annoy as it doesn't make anyone feel guilty.

The size of the text used in the labeling may be difficult to read for someone with difficulties in reading small print. It may be also difficult for someone with seeing difficulties to read text on coloured background. It may be easier for someone with reading difficulties to understand a single sign (positive sign or negative alert) with a clearly descriptive image and/or text than a more complicated label. It may be difficult for someone with specific diet or restrictions for health or other (maybe religious) reasons to judge whether they can use the product just based on nutritional or health alert information. ,Yes,Yes,I do not know,,I don't know,perhaps positive single signs like the Finnish example of the Heart symbol could also be considered to avoid negative/guilty feelings negative alerts may cause (and because of negative feelings the warnings would be ignored). Perhaps industry would be also then motivated to align their ingredients to fit a defined criteria that would allow the use of such a positive sign. A combination single signs and some type of coloured scale and nutritional information (not necessarily on coloured background) could also be considered.,,Yes,"I don't have evidence but the more complicated the front of pack label, the more people would need to understand about nutrition and be able to interpret such information.

I thought it was such a good idea and very simple to use.

I like to keep healthy so MTLs are essential for my food choices.",Yes,Yes,Very easy,Very easy,Very easy,Easy,I recognise that some of my suggestions would requires changes to EU FIR. I have listed suggestions in order of importance. 1) Remove the inclusion of Kj to declare energy; no one uses or understands Kj. Simplify the energy declaration on the MTL to 'calories'. 2) Remove the separate declaration of energy per 100g/100ml. These figures clutter the label and could cause unnecessary confusion. 3) The words '% of Reference Intake' below the nutrient lozenges should be a standard part of the design. Those words should not be relegated to elsewhere on the package via an asterisk by the %numbers in the lozenges. A Walkers crisp packet illustrates what I mean. 4) More encouragement to use a horizontal format and large enough typeface. I know there is plenty of clear guidance on this issue so I won't press it any further but it is frustrating that companies still can't get it right. 5) Update the official guidance to reflect the IGD 2018 Best Practice guide on MTL FOPNL. In particular the amount of colour in each lozenge: 2/3 is better than 1/3 because its easier to see.  ,Yes,,,No,,,,Like,Like,Dislike,Like,"The Nutriscore system is useful and it works really well overall but I do not think it is right for the UK. Firstly the UK has well established MTL FOPNL that has been used in one form or another for 15 years. It's wide adoption since 2013 has raised consumer awareness and understanding and so all that hard work would have been for nothing if it was abandoned for Nutriscore. Secondly the big problem with Nutriscore is that there is no mechanism within the its algorithm to take into account larger portion sizes or where the food contributes a significant proportion of the %RI. Example: Sainsbury's Taste the Difference Cottage Pie provides 58% RI of saturates, 2.25g salt and less than 40% vegetable content but yet incredibly is awarded an A rating! A related problem comes when looking at larger portions of the same product such as 'king size'. Example a King Size Pot noodle is 26% larger than standard and contains 10g saturates and yet gets what I consider a generous C rating. I would have thought D would be better. ",Dislike,Dislike,Dislike,I dislike this scheme. I don't like the idea of warning labels because if 'demonises' foods. Our current system is more informative because it shows specific information and treats all foods equally. I can't believe you have included this for consideration. ,I do not know,,I do not know,,,I don't think any other FOPNLs should be considered. I know some retailers use endorsement labels on their own brands such as Asda's Live Better logo and Waitrose's Good Health to highlight the healthiest choices within category. I have no evidence of their efficacy but I would suggest that if retailers or manufacturers wished to use such logos they be based on a standardised criteria. In any case they should be supplementary and entirely separate from the MTL. The best course of action would be to improve what we have now. Make it mandatory. ,,,Yes,It is clearly absurd that the sugar from a carrot is treated the same as sugar in a cake. The original 2006 MTL by the Food Standards Agency reflected the (then) advise on sugar and set the colour thresholds of non-milk extrinsic sugars (NMES) based on the (then) RI of 50g. They compromised with the food industry by allowing the figure of total sugars to be declared on the FOP but the colour coding thresholds would be based on the RI of non-milk extrinsic sugars. So the high threshold was set at >12.5g NMES per 100g (25% of 50g). This sensible approach thus allowed differentiation between products which had the same total sugars but one of which would contain mostly free sugars. It also meant that products with high levels of intrinsic sugars would not receive a red signpost. The figure of 90g RI for total sugars must also lead to an over consumption of free sugars. A 330ml Coca Cola provides 39% RI of total sugars but in reality it provides 116% of free sugars. The sugar lozenge should therefore declare the amount of free sugar.,No,The problem with integrating fibre into the label is that it is a nutrient to be increased rather than limited as with energy and fat etc. This would lead to confusion because the figure for fibre would have to be interpreted differently to those of the other five. It certainly could not be colour coded because it would mess up the colours' meaning. If it were to be reflected in the label then the only way I could see it work would be for a sixth neutral coloured lozenge to the right of the salt one set somewhat separately to the first five. This would simply state the amount of fibre in grams per portion.  ,,No,I am not in a position to really know.,I do not know,I do not know,I do not know,,No,,,Yes,First of all it should read: 'Do you think that the proposals in this consultation could AFFECT people from more deprived backgrounds?' We know from previous research that Nutriscore and MTLs perform best amongst all socio-economic groups  when assessing comprehension and usability of various FOPNLs.

You do not have to have an eating disorder to have a disordered view on food & I believe we have a society that has an extremely disordered view on food & this is why these traffic light system’s, etc, will never work & will just continue to contribute to a disordered society.",I do not have a view,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,,I do not know,,I do not know,,,Education on nutrition can not be simplified to the extent of putting it on the front of food packaging.,"A healthy relationship with food must be taught from a young age & it must be taught with the psychological & social aspects included. We shouldn’t tell people things are as simple as ‘good’ or ‘bad’ because they aren’t. People need to be taught early on that everything is good provided it’s in moderation. Australia have a good template to help those recovering from an eating disorder called ‘the REAL food pyramid’ - this incorporates nutrition as well as the social & mental health aspects & although it’s used to help those with eating disorders, I believe it’s a fantastic resource to help everybody develop a healthy relationship with food, which in the long-term.. would hopefully lead to the population making more informed choices contributing to a healthier lifestyle.",,I do not know,"I do not believe that sugar should be traffic light coded, but I do think it’s sensible to include the amount on the packaging (not necessarily on the front though) - I think it’s sensible because those with diabetes do need to be aware as it can be a matter of life or death & their sugar levels obviously need to be kept as normal & as stable as possible. Some people with diabetes experience hypoglycaemia though, so they would be in need of a high sugar item & that’s another reason why it shouldn’t be colour coded as red, because a person experiencing a hypo would be in need of a high sugar item. As a person with Anorexia Nervosa, I have often experienced severe hypos just as badly as a person with type 1 diabetes & seeing a high sugar food colour coded as red has previously put me off buying it, even though it was something my body needed.",I do not know,"Fibre is important for bowel health, so it is important to include the information on the package, but again.. I do not believe this needs to be on the front or in a colour. Some people with digestive problems also require low fibre foods, as a high fibre diet could actually exacerbate their condition - this is another example of somebody needing a diet that may not be inline with a generic recommendation.",,Yes,"Statistically, there are in fact people who are far more likely to be at risk of developing eating disorders & although anyone can be impacted..statistics show that females, adolescents & young adults are at greater risk, so these people would probably be more vulnerable to the negative side when being exposed to front of pack nutrition labelling.",No,No,No,It would achieve an even more disordered society & would likely not make a difference in reducing obesity.,Yes,"Remove them & instead.. invest in early education incorporating mental & social aspects into nutritional education, so that people develop a mentally healthy relationship with food.",,I do not know,,,,I do not have a view,,I do not have a view,What about the long-term costs of the system having a damaging impact?,,"I feel as though the seriousness of eating disorders are completely overlooked, despite the long-term costs. Obviously there are a whole host of issues here that overlook any kind of empathy & compassion, but if this is primarily focussing on the financial impacts, then anything exacerbating eating disorders always has the potential to severely increase financial demand on the system. Eating disorder treatment can be extremely expensive (especially inpatient treatment), as can the impacts of having a long-term eating disorder. Eating disorders can lead to long-term health problems that are also expensive & chronic eating disorders also lead to lack of employment, a reliance on benefits & other long-term mental health problems that also require further treatment that again..adds to expense. So if the agenda here is to reduce the costs of obesity on the system..perhaps the government should also consider the costs of the long-term negative impacts these proposals could have. I would also ask how the government intend on measuring negative consequences or if this is going to be ignored?",,,Disappointed,Social Media,Department of Health & Social Care,"Consult with those who have lived experience of eating disorders, as well as eating disorder professionals including psychiatrists, psychologists, occupational therapists & most importantly..advanced specialist eating disorder dietitians!",18e566a3-04db-4126-b0d7-abf8b56eae71,26/08/2020 09:17

Any foods that weren't an A would've terrified me and I would have avoided eating them at all costs including missing out on social gatherings, birthday parties etc. I have fought for years against my ED so I can live a happy and fulfilled life without it. This would not only put me at risk of relapse as I don't know what I would do when presented with these labels, it would also put the lives of people living in the depths of an ED at further risk and I know for a fact that it will kill people.

This is based on the increased societal focus on calories, weight loss and stigmatising of certain foods. This societal focus makes it more likely that people will develop eating disorders, and makes recovering from them more difficult as they cannot escape the information that is reinforcing the negative thoughts of the eating disorder i.e. &#34;this product has high fat and is labeled RED, it is bad!&#34; = I should not eat it. By this logic most foods should be feared, the sufferer has little they can safely eat and the illness grows. This is very dangerous and potentially fatal. Calorie information, diet culture and eating disorders is akin to alcohol promotion, drinking culture and alcoholism. Encouraging people to drink alcohol is seen as detrimental. Encouraging people to focus on calorie information is likewise detrimental.

Two - there is plenty of debate on what is ‘good’ and ‘bad’ even with detailed nutritional labelling and percentage of daily intake figures.  If food labelling is to work there needs to be a large scale educational programme to inform consumers what constitutes a ‘good’ rating and what is ‘bad’. ,"A clear labelling system, backed up with a professional education campaign to the public will enable people to make informed healthier purchasing decisions.  This must be linked with an assessment of individual lifestyles which combines nutrient intake with energy expenditure – an athlete training or heavy manual worker will have a totally different energy need to an office worker taking no exercise and it is against this that whether a food is ‘good’ or ‘bad’ should be judged.",,Yes,"The latest dietary advice should be included so that people can make an informed decision. Whatever labelling solution is agreed, consumers should be able to glance at a product and understand if it is healthy and what levels of sugar etc. it contains. Looking in multiple places to source this information will not be welcome by most people. Sugar on it’s own is not a bad ingredient, indeed it provides energy.  It’s when it is taken in excess that problems arise, so to focus solely on the amount of sugar in a product is a very simplistic ( but in some ways helpful) guide.",Yes,"Yes, the latest dietary advice should be included so that people can make an informed decision, as part of an overall message.",,No,,No,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Carbon labelling should also be included – global warming is a real danger and prominent in the media on a daily basis.

It makes it easier to make choices between choosing one product over another. Some products packaging also often look healthy but do not contain the FOPL and you look at the back on the nutritional facts table and they are very high in sugar and saturated fats which I believe is misleading for consumers.",Yes,Yes,Very easy,Very easy,Very easy,Moderate,"Portion size is a difficult one, for example if you have a burger then fine that is classed as 94g and is one portion, however if you have a tub of ice cream for example and a portion size is 30g, its very hard for a consumer to envisage in their mind how much 30g is unless they get home and weigh it out. Using phrases such as a quarter of the tub of ice cream or a 1/5 if more useful in consumers being able to understand how much the traffic light system applies to of a particular product. ",Yes,,,No,,,,Dislike,Dislike,Dislike,Dislike,,Dislike,I do not have a view,Dislike,,No,,No,,,See comments in next question. ,"In the USA on their back of pack nutrition label they have mandatory requirements to list the serving size of a product, so for example 1 pizza contains 12 servings or 1 tub of ice cream contains 4 servings, this really helps users envisage how much they can consume of a product and it be in relation to the traffic light system on the front of pack. I think the USA have it right when it comes to serving sizes and they are estimated from the typical US consumers serving size, not just what USA consumers should be eating as a serving size. For example in the UK many cereal boxes state that a typical serving size is 30g for a portion, which is fine on the traffic light system indicating the product has relatively low levels of sugar/ salt and sat fat etc, but most UK consumers are actually consuming between 45-50g of cereal and if this portion size was reflected on the FOPL then that may change the colours of the nutritional content and that product may not be as healthy for an individual as they had once thought. So really I believe portion size and the FOPL go hand in hand and we need to be informing consumers really what the most average serving size in the UK is compared to just saying what UK consumers SHOULD be consuming when in reality they probably arn't. This also has an impact on what choices a UK consumer might make between cereals, for example lots of cereal companies at the moment opt for a lower serving option of 30g to make their products on the traffic light system look healthier, when in fact a consumer was eating 40-50g of their product then it would not be a very healthy choice. ",,Yes,"I think this is a good idea, but I don't know if there is enough information out there in the public yet for some consumers to understand the difference between total sugar and free sugars and how they can impact your health, so personally I think an educational campaign or piece would be needed to inform the public of the difference and why it is important it is highlighted on FOPL and how it can help you make healthier choices as a consumer. ",Yes,"I think labelling fibre on FOPL is a really good idea, however I know that many companies use the fibre health claim on their products such as high in fibre which can often make consumers feel like it is a healthy choice of product, but the product is high in sugar or saturated fat. So fibre claims can be really misleading! I think there needs to be a strict set of fibres that are actually beneficial for health backed by science, meaning that not any product can slap a fibre claim on their product. Same goes if fibre was to be included on the FOPL then I think it would have to be very strictly regulated to ensure consumers know even though a product is high in fibre it may be high in sugar and saturated fat etc. Also certain types of fibre are more useful to the body than others so it would be good to define which type of fibre the product contains. ",,No,"I don't believe so, the FOPL traffic light scheme we have is very clear and concise and is understandable for any age range or group.  ",Yes,Yes,Yes,"The traffic light system is pretty much accessible to all meaning all groups can access and understand the information presented to them, helping them make healthier life choices regardless of their background or up bringing. ",I don't know,,,Yes,"There is plenty of evidence to suggest that individuals from deprived backgrounds or poor socio-economic status run the risk of being more over weight or obese that other individuals in other socio-economic groups, this traffic light system is accessible to all and can really be used as an educational tool to try and help their individuals make the right choices no matter what background they are from.

I think this is very misleading and will lead to people making what they think is a healthy choice. I know the colours refer to per 100g and are standardised, however people often look at the calories/figures and if they see low calories think that's then healthy. The nutrient figures should be realistic based on the product and how much a person is likely to eat. for example, it's unlikely a person is only going to eat 1/4 of a pizza, so would be more helpful to state the values per full pizza or at least 1/2 the pizza.

Nobody eats half a tin of soup or beans etc for example. Packets should always have the traffic light system present. I hate having to pick up another item to read the recommended intake of things like salt and fat and then work out the percentages myself for the item I actually want. Not every item uses a portion size in grams and instead just show a picture of a 'recommended portion' which is also really unhelpful. Gravy often does this and it's absolutely unhelpful to only see a picture of a liquid on some other food items. The traffic light system is not present on takeaways or on menus in restaurants, it should be. Some items have different colours to other items for the same percentage of RDI, the colours should be standardised and enforced instead of some items having orange for what others would have as red or green. I use the traffic light system to know how to look after myself. If it's not made more clear then it's just making it difficult for people to be healthy. As sold values should always be present and it would also be helpful to have as cooked for items, especially frozen meats etc. All food items should have the traffic light system, perhaps even fresh fruits and vegetables would be useful. More categories on another part of the packaging would be useful for other things that people might want to know about an item, such as macronutrients.",Yes,,,Yes,,Nutri-score,,Like,Like,Dislike,Like,I would still want to see the percentages broken down.,Dislike,Dislike,Dislike,,No,,No,,,"For items such as cheese, saying per so many grams is not helpful. A picture showing approximately how much of the block is being referred to would be useful. If foods lack nutrients that people need then using big lettering and colours would be helpful. For example, if a food lacks vitamins and have high calories then it would be useful to know that. Some people may completely subsist on very few items of food, especially students. It's not enough to only keep the percents of fat/salt/sugar down to below the RDI.  The RDI for a whole packet of food should also be present along with traffic lights for if you consumed the entire food product in one sitting. Often I will find people eat an entire packet of a food item at once and won't consider that it has hundreds of percent of the RDI of something. This should be in addition to the regular traffic light system for a different portion and you might actually have in a healthy amount.",Perhaps showing how many steps at a moderate pace you would need to walk to use that many calories up?,,Yes,"If sugars can be broken down into glucose then it should be included. Perhaps having 2 items of sugar like there are for fat would be useful. It's especially important that diabetics would be able to access the information on non-free sugars as they would still become usable sugars quickly in the body. Yes, the sugars present in (fresh) fruits and vegetables shoild be included and should also have the traffic light system applied to them. If lactose / galactose are included in RDI percents for sugars then it would presumably be ok in terms of lactose-intollerant people who would not consume the item in the first place if clear information was present about the kinds of sugars.  Total sugars should not be completely removed.",Yes,I struggle to get fibre and it would be useful to know how much of a RDI I would get from some items.,,Yes,RDI is based on adults but older adults need different intakes. The calorie intake recommendation is 2000kcal and this is different based on sex. Pregnant people may need different intakes. People undergoing gender reassignment may struggle particularly with salt intake and would benefit from increased use of the traffic light system.,No,No,No,,I don't know,,,Yes,Social deprivation makes people buy the most cost effective things to eat. It's useful to know what is in food so that they get enough to eat per day as apposed to what I'm assuming is the intent; to get people to eat less of something which is high in calories and fat / sugar / salt.

The issue of educating people more about the benefits of healthy eating, commences in childhood, and as we grow up, we should by then be able to make a decision on what’s heathy and what’s not. One of the main issues, is that there is far to much choice, particularly on foods which are unhealthy. Many of the large UK Supermarkets provide a complete aisle for just crisps, for example.   Only by  educating individuals better regarding food labelling needs will change people’s eating habits.  Undertaking strategic polls which ask the right questions and make those being polled, (ideally from across as wide a set of people in any one area as possible), to probe their thoughts and minds. Why do they eat (unhealthy) food types XYZ. Polling questions should include a wide spectrum of; fresh, perishable and frozen foods.  It’s a case of striking the right benefits. Whilst spending £100,000,000 million on a strategically thought out set of questions, and choosing your intended target ‘audience’ with some really carefully scripted questions which will make people really think hard to tease out of the public the answers you are looking for.  is a large amount of moneyon a well developed poll questionnaire, if nothing, if it saves the NHS £100,000,000,000. much do you spend on education, verses the payback in reducing the NHS and employer . Unhealthy diets lead to rising costs for the NHS in general, both in terms of obesity, heart disease, blood pressure etc.  Improving these areas by better education and understanding of what food labelling can do to make healthier choices are by far the most important aspects for healthier lifestyles.",Yes,"The annex states that the Traffic Light System is a long-running scheme, commencing in 2013.  It further states that;   • Research demonstrates a consumer preference to both nutritional data and colour-coded adviceii. This evidence suggests colour-coding helps consumers make choices quickly.  • It is voluntary, so not all products are front-labelled, but uptake by industry is high, particularly among supermarkets. Minor variations in label design are prevalent and this variety may make it harder to compare products and/or maintain consistency (although it appears that many labels do adhere to the broad design and content of the recommended scheme).  • Recent researchiii suggests 80% of consumers look at the FOPNL (60% sometimes refer to labels and 20% always consider them). The other 20% do not look at them. There is evidence of inequality in that the MTL labels are less likely to be used by those from more deprived background.

Maybe if this was looked into, (legislate) to ensure that food manufacturers included the Traffic Lights on all their various food products it would be a further step forward into having a well understood and simple method of labelling food.

I also have an intolerance to some foods.  However, under supervision at the pharmacy I found that 400 calories a day was as much as my body NEEDED and that does not translate into a very healthy or sustainable weight loss.  It does lead to excess wrinkles and hair loss though!  I think the food industry does not always take into account mineral content of food...some cereals do add vitamins etc. but much of our food is bled dry of anything worthwhile, selenium, copper, zinc, magnesium etc.  Nuts are good but high in fat!  If you are old, rely on local shops, some of which have limited stock, or often in my local nothing fresh on the shelves, it is very difficult to find a balanced diet.  Perhaps there is scope, in this newly emerging economy, and shun the fatty era which is upon us (although that is not new, even the doctors are inclined to ignore you if you are fat), to set up a company providing the whole package, so little effort is needed to find nourishing, low fat, low sugar, low salt ...low everything food.",,Yes,,Yes,,,,,No,No,No,,I don't know,"My view is that all the above is gobbly gook to fulfil some fanciful paper that has to be written.

I don't believe that to be true, I think it is more likely that their choices are limited by lack of funds, or having no foundation in life.  (When I was young we rarely saw fresh fruit.  An orange was luxury in the Christmas stocking.  When I reached 18 and came across a fresh grapefruit I had no idea which way it should be halved eg.  We just did not have the money in the family to indulge on variety.  Sweets were a luxury too; I can't recall crisps at all)  Perhaps more could be done in the school to encourage both boys and girls to cook nutritious food, and the Govt. should throw money at the school to provide the ingredients rather than the families. (This is to ensure that the people from deprived areas are on a level footing with others).When my kids were cooking at school they invariably forgot to tell me what ingredients they needed for the class until the morning of the class.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...

It was obvious that we needed something new and different and radical, based upon the economic crash of 2008 which affected us quite badly.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...

It was obvious that we needed something new and different and radical, based upon the economic crash of 2008 which affected us quite badly.  That wealth extraction, that straight-jacket that we’re in, we want to tackle by offering an alternative…  So, you’re getting that virtual cycle of keeping wealth in the community and democratising the wealth as well, and democratising the economy.

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...

In 2012 I was detained under the mental health act for almost three and a half years. I spent time in various psychiatric hospitals and an Assessment and Treatment Unit. The reason I was there was because I am autistic and other people, who were not experts in autism, decided I should not be allowed to leave. Whilst there I was drugged, restrained, secluded, put in long term segregation. I was mistreated.  The events witnessed in the recent Panorama documentary ‘Hospital Abuse Scandal’ and which I detail in my book, Unbroken, showed vulnerable adults who are autistic or have a learning disability being abused and mistreated. These events were truly shocking but because of my experiences, I did not find them surprising.  That’s why I’m working with the National Autistic Society to try and bring about change.  To watch the denial of vulnerable people’s human rights should be regarded as a national scandal but all the more so considering the Government has failed to stop the use of inpatient units such as Whorlton Hall, through its recently-ended Transforming Care programme.  Over 2,000 children and adults remain locked up despite Government promises to end their use.  This is not a question of money, or funding – millions of pounds are spent on keeping vulnerable children and adults locked up hundreds of miles from their homes. This is about where the money is spent and what kind of service it is spent on. Autism and learning disabilities are not a mental health condition.  My time in inpatient care cost the state approximately £2.5 million. In reality I could have been easily treated closer to or even in my home and with the support of my family and friends which would have cost a fraction of this amount. The right use of the money spent on locking up autistic people and people with a learning disability is on community services, where people can be in their own homes or closer to their families, not in mental health inpatient units.  Instead I was locked up, shut off from my family, leaving my baby daughter with no mother for months.  I needed help – I asked for help – and instead I got this.  The time has come for reviews and investigations to end. No more empty promises. No more warm words.   We need action from the Government to stop the use of inpatient units and to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable adults like me, and like Clare, Alex and Paul who we saw in the documentary, who are autistic or have a learning disability.   I call upon the Government to end the abuse and mistreatment of autistic people and people with a learning disability in inpatient units by doing to the following:      Declare that autistic people and people with a learning disability are #HumanToo and must have their human rights safeguarded     Immediately commit to make money available to set up the right community services for autistic people and people with a learning disability - and that this is ring-fenced     Change the wording of the definition of ‘mental disorder’ in the Mental Health Act, which currently includes autism and learning disability – whilst legally safeguarding ‘at risk’ individuals access to Care & Treatment Reviews     Establish accountability right across Government to make sure this happens  For information and support on this issue you can visit the National Autistic Society website.  https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/audio-video/population-health-animation  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHkozMIXZ8w  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvba62gObhw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4LwS5GPgEA  The data speaks for itself.  Each admission, each electro convulsive treatment , restraint, each seclusion, each serious incident, each medication error is a human rights abuse.  We just need to listen?  Alexis Quinn?  Act wisely?  We are not using public money – our money well (each admission costs at least £18K)  We need to learn from Italy, Finland, Manchester and others.  Work together?  How will we put the change we need into action? not just strategy papers?  We need the other part of this “picture” the data from the Haven and community.  In summary my aims are ...  All Mental Health Hospitals should be closed as per Italy; the Haven/ respite/ Home Group model should be adopted - which is part of the NHS long term plan.  The Mental Health Act should be abolished, one of the few areas of law where you can be locked away for something you may do, by people who have a vested interest in locking you away  (James Davies work CRACKED why psychiatry is doing more harm than good is relevant here?)  People should be supported to come off psychiatric drugs if this is their wish ...  Move from a Medical model of distress to a social / Human Rights model of distress ...  From Paternalism to human rights ...  Citizen assemblies, community right to buy, community commissioning, participatory budgeting?

Do-gooders, scientists, doctors have money so can individually select what food they seem OK.  Allow me to give you an example of BAD DESCRIPTION:  Honey is honey is honey regardless where it comes from around the world as long as it is PURE HONEY meaning not mixed or adulterated by other honey or additives, an example:  Manuka honey is allegedly the highest grading and yet it is a mixture of many honeys from around the world so the grading in your eyes should be low, yet is has the highest grade, why?  Manuka in the beginning was 'dark-brown' or 'black' that originates from New Zealand. A beekeeper in NZ is automatically a member of the 'farming industry' unlike in the UK who are deemed as 'hobbyists'.  25/30 years ago NZ beekeepers could not sell their dark/black honey so being part of the Government Ministery to Farming they complained who in their wisdom got a scientist to prove Manuka was medicinally better than any other and to prove they increased the price 10-fold to allow the purchaser to believe if they are paying more then it must be better, wrong!  People are so gullible to believe this scam but it worked, the problem is their success was the reason why Manuka Honey changed colour!  Why?  NZ produce 17,000 tonnes each year, they only have so many trees so cannot produce any more, but they sell worldwide 30,000 tonnes.  To meat the demand other honeys are mixed in meaning other honey is just as medicinal as Manuka otherwise they would tell us and down-grade the product and more importantly bring the price down to match other honey, but then that has not happened and the scam continues.  This action proves whatever you put on the label is never considered except the price of what you can afford.  Manuka honey is no different from the honey you buy at a local fete, village shop or local beekeeper, in fact it is more PURE than any honey from any other country.  Do you see my point where the same thinking process is used by the medical profession that you trust implicitly and yet Doctors like Ian Patterson was eventually found out and convicted by a 'flawed medical science' where he was also motivated by a financial agenda that may women suffered and died because he could use an outdated protocol policy for his personal gain and perverted ambitions. He is just the tip of the iceberg!  Until a New Law is enforced on medical science to change an outdated Victorian era protocol policy it will continue where doctors have a 'licence to kill' with no repercussions unless you get greedy like Ian Patterson.",No,No,No,Please read all my comments and the letter addressed and sent by Royal Mail to the PM. Thank you.,Yes,"My research will completely revamp an outdated protocol that needs to change but then are you prepared to listen and be guided by Science or alleged experts who were educated by the same 'flawed' education protocol so they would know no different and possibly disagree with my comments, but then if they do not know any better then they would believe what they have been told because nobody ever questions Doctors or Scientist assuming everything they say to be 'gospel'.

I would like to see a standard for all food labelling that specifies a limited range of legible fonts and their colours, as well as the backgrounds, all selected for legibility. I would ban white writing of any sort. This presents problems in general, and for some minorities including people with dyslexia or autism this can be particularly frustrating",Dislike,Dislike,Dislike,"White writing is a bad idea, for legibility reasons stated above.

While I can understand why any food process supplier would be reluctant to accept a labelling scheme that labels their goods as less healthy, they are benefitting from our national health and public health systems and putting an unsustainable burden on them. Therefore, to do business in the UK and maintain our markets in EU, I believe we should adopt a rigorous scheme of health labelling for all food products that mitigates health harms and conduces towards healthier eating. Objections about the rights of consumers to make their own choices without state interference are not credible in light of public health issues related to obesity, diabetes, heart and renal disease,  and cancers associated with eating habits, especially when made by people who profit from food processing.","From pre-school onwards, citizenship should be taught and cover things like responsible eating and other behaviours. Where this conflicts with family behaviours that are unhealthy then social intervention should be indicated",,Yes,"The indication of sugar and carb contents should be conditional upon the label information clarifying the amount of sugar added compared to what would be in the food intrinsically, and also indicating how much exercise would be needed to consume the carbohydrate content of the food. Carbohydrates being a necessary part of a healthy diet, choosing the amount to consume to reflect energy needs of the individual should be facilitated by the labelling.  Regarding fibre and carbs, it is obvious that lifestyle in general and work life balance in particular are going to affect how much is healthy for each individual, so indicators are needed for both",Yes,"The indicators for fibre should also take into account how much exercise is needed, which in turn should take into account work and lifestyle",,Yes,some health conditions and disabilities require clearer writing to enable understanding.

The upload tool will only permit one attachment. i could have attached dozens of research papers all indicating similar findings - social deprivation and poor diet go hand in hand to elevate health harms that are expensive to treat and cause huge financial and social loss. The moral case for addressing this is overwhelming, but purely in terms of sustainability and financial efficacy, labelling is not enough - there need to be more active measures of prevention, targetting social deprivation and providing healthier food for deprived areas",5f352b65c4a74c26a07a0209,,Yes,"The crucial question is whether FOPNL influences consumer choice. Given the wide uptake in supermarkets, and that up to 80% of people look at the FOPNL information, can it be that the other 20% account for the majority of the increasing health harms from diet? That is very unlikely indeed. Improving FOPNL without any more radical measures to influence consumer choice will have at best a marginal effect. The accelerating rate of health harms from diet would have shown at least some fluctuation since 2013 if FOPNL was effective on its own, but the report lacks any rigorous data regarding the effects of FOPNL on consumer choice and consequent health",Yes,"Considering the health and social impact of health harms from diet, the overall costs of labelling changes are trivial compared to the staggering costs to society of health harms from diet",Yes,"While the UK scheme is more informative, the single measure of balances from the European scheme is also helpful.

It would also help people like diabetics help to control their sugar intake.  Overall it might help to reduce cholesterol levels in the UK if more information in such as clear format was provided for consumers to see.",Yes,Some people with health conditions need higher fibre levels and it is known that fibre contributes to reduced cholesterol and less intestinal/gut problems.  Therefore making it easier to see what is higher in fibre than other products can only be a good thing.  The UK is told that we all need to increase our fibre intake and this would be a simple way to help give consumers confidence to make that choice.,,I do not know,"Whilst I am unsure, it is possible that for those people who come into the protected categories or are pregnant etc. or those from ethnic backgrounds that are prone to certain medical conditions, might benefit from having such information on as many products as possible.

I cannot believe that for major food suppliers it would be expensive and surely there must be a way of supporting niche suppliers to get additional testing undertaken without incurring excessive costs to do so.  If the information shows that as a result less people are buying a product compared to a competitors as a result of it being less healthy, wouldn't this system give them the opportunity to make the changes necessary by being able to use market research to find out why their product is not being bought.",I do not have a view,,,,Satisfied,Received an email,,,f7e63f14-47d6-41b9-b798-25de66a7ca91,13/08/2020 11:21

Without the  NHS backing people don’t take it seriously. The Nutriscore would mislead Diabetics and people restricting carbs.

If you look into it in more detail it may be better to have a lower recommendation on total sugar instead. Raw vegetables are generally better than raw fruit.

I also believe that 'per portion' could be made clearer...I have seen examples on some food labels where the manufacturer's idea of a 'portion' is quite unrealistic compared to the average consumer's portion. One example of this is the 500ml bottles of 'Oasis' that you often see in supermarkets as part of a meal deal. On the Tesco website (and I believe also on the bottle', the information on the back is listed as per 100ml and per 250ml.

Supermarkets manipulate the system to make the product look healthier in terms of colour, but just reduce the serving size. 4) Whilst the percentages are a good reference, there is no education on the fact that this is a generalisation.

1921,,an organisation,,,,,,,Yes,Yes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (Faculty of Dentistry),Policy and Public Affairs Officer,Medical Royal College,50 to 249 employees,The whole of the UK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Not relevant,"Whilst I personally do, this response is on behalf of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh's Faculty of Dentistry. It is absolutely clear that the principle reason for dental decay is sugar in the diet. The hidden sugars in many ready-made meals and in carbonated drinks are still the reason adults and in particular parents remain unaware of the risk they are exposing themselves and their children to.  Dental extractions because of decay caused by sugar in children are the biggest reason for a child between 5 and 9 years of age to be admitted to hospital in the UK. The NHS spent £30 million on dental extractions in 2012/13  and in 2014/15 the NHS in England provided multiple dental extractions under general anaesthesia for 45,935 children.  Because of a lack of trained specialists in Paediatric Dentistry the waiting list for such extractions up and down the country is a concern for the profession and finding suitable theatre space in hospitals remains an issue even for the Dental Hospitals. This has been exacerbated by the backlog of surgical operations caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, with tooth extraction being a low priority for scarce and pressurised operating theatre capacity. Sugary drinks account for on average 30% of 4 to 10 year olds daily intake and this may be explained by the fact that only 1 in 5 parents said they had advice on this risk. It is clear from this that the existing traffic light system of front of pack nutrition (FOPN) labelling is not well understood.",No,No,Somewhat difficult,Moderate,Difficult,Difficult,"•	A large-scale public health awareness campaign on how the public can use front of pack nutrition labelling to ensure a better diet for them and their children.  •	Inclusion of titratable acidity in the traffic light food labelling system. •	Consider making the traffic light logos more prominent on packaging.  •	Traffic light logos are based on what the manufacturers consider a single ‘portion’ – this is rarely aligned with what the general public consider a single portion and therefore a standardised system of portion sizes should be set up, by health experts and nutritionists, against which the traffic light rating is judged.  ",Yes,,,I do not know,,Nutri-score,,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,I do not have a view,,I do not know,,I do not know,,,,,,Yes,"Yes but this is insufficient alone. Often forgotten is the effect acid dissolution of teeth is having on the community. This is not simply a matter of PH but is largely down to the titratable acidity of the drinks. Currently about 30% of children have acid erosion in their deciduous teeth and 1/3 of young adults have signs of acid dissolution in their permanent teeth; in 2% of cases this is severe. In this instance the focus on the risk of sugar has actually had a detrimental effect as it has made parents think that sugar-free options are a healthy option for their children’s teeth. For example, regular Coca Cola is bad from a sugar point of view but although Diet Coke has no sugar it has a much worse titratable acidity. Many parents get Diet Coke for their children thinking it is a healthier alternative to regular Coca Cola, but in terms of dental decay this is in fact a less healthy option. The acid erosion of teeth that results is expensive to repair and is on the increase. An issue with the lack of knowledge around diet and public health is that assumption that only that which is covered by the existing traffic light system matters for that. This is what has led to the situation whereby fizzy drinks with low or no sugar are seen as healthier alternatives when in fact, due to their titratable acid levels, they cause significant oral health damage. The obvious solution to this is to add titratable acidity to the traffic light FOPN system. ",I do not know,,,I do not know,,I do not know,I do not know,I do not know,,Yes,"The first recommendation has to be a large-scale public health awareness campaign on how the public can use the traffic light FOPN labelling to ensure a better diet for them and their children. Food labels are pointless when 80% of parents do not know how to use them. We are in a moment in history when public health advice is foremost in people’s minds because of the pandemic. There is little doubt that the co-morbidities associated with poor, sugar-rich diets – in particular obesity and diabetes – increase the mortality of Covid-19. Therefore a public health awareness campaign as to the existing traffic light FOPN system and how it can be used to make healthier choices is paramount. Indeed, this need not wait for new legislation but should be implemented as soon as possible.   As above a further issue with the lack of knowledge around diet and public health is that assumption that only that which is covered by the existing traffic light system matters for that. This is what has led to the situation whereby fizzy drinks with low or no sugar are seen as healthier alternatives when in fact, due to their titratable acid levels, they cause significant oral health damage. The obvious solution to this is to add titratable acidity to the traffic light FOPN system.   A study should be conducted as to how effective the traffic light FOPN system is at delivering the messages it is intending at its current level of prominence on packaging. Consideration should be given to changes to the design or prominence to increase understanding, for example the section with the traffic lights on the packaging could have a border in green, amber or red to indicate whether, overall, the particular product should be considered a staple or a treat.   The most common lie in the 21st Century is “Feeds two”. The current traffic light FOPN system is based on the manufacturers assessment of what a single ‘portion’ is and frequently this is considerably smaller than the general public’s notion of a single portion. This can lead to manipulation of the traffic light FOPN system. Consideration should be made to coming up with a standardised system of portion sizes of various food groups and the traffic light FOPN system based on those. Such a system should be devised by health experts and nutritionists and manufacturers should have input into but not control over the process of establishing and maintaining that system.  ",,Yes,"Poorer families are at more risk than the well off, both because they have less access to expensive fresh food and less time to prepare meals. The existence of high levels of sugar in ready meals and other quicker alternatives is not well understood, meaning that there is less demand for a healthier, less sugary alternative option. If parents understood how to use the traffic light FOPN system better this might create a demand for the market to fill for healthier, quick meal options. ",,,I do not have a view,"Childhood obesity has risen to the extent that 1/3rd of children aged 2 to 15 years in the UK are obese. Obesity already costs the NHS £4.2 billion a year and is set rise to £10 billion by 2050. The NHS spent £30 million on dental extractions in 2012/13 and in 2014/15 the NHS in England provided multiple dental extractions under general anaesthesia for 45,935 children. These costs should be included in any cost-benefit analysis.

I think in the longer term, although there would be an initial outlay, it could be more cost effective to have a much simpler labeling system, which the Nutri-score is (another aside - I had never heard of the Nutri-score before filling this in), especially as there's a major problem in this country with obesity and it's related health problems, which has continued with the MTL labels in place. The Nutri-score seems similar to me to the energy efficiency label all white goods have to have showing how efficient they are, with A being the best and the lower letters not so good.

Meanwhile the &#34;Sugar&#34; category completely ignores the starch and other similarly unhealthy simple carbohydrates simply because they aren't technically sugar. This ignores the fact that the glycemic effect of starch and other refined carbs is nearly identical to pure sugar. This system leads to low-nutrient, plain, unseeded white baguettes scoring entirely green despite having a glycemic index of above 90 which, in excess, leads to high spikes in blood sugar, diabetes, fatty liver disease and obesity.

A product being high in salt isn't bad if the individual eating it has sweated a lot during the day, or performed high intensity exercise, rather it's beneficial.  Frankly a rating based on how calorie dense a product is might be a better route? For example, french toast made with sugar, a whole egg, cinnamon and white bread is stupidly calorie dense (Roughly 180kcal/slice) when compared to french toast made from sweetener, egg white, cinnamon and wholemeal bread.

Dressings are wayyyy too many calories and are overused by so many people. Further, people even add olive oil to salads because it is being marketed as &#34;Healthy&#34;. A teaspoon of olive oil is 40kcal, that is insane and should not be promoted because it contains &#34;Healthy fats&#34;, same thing with nuts. Peanut butter is nearly double the protein content than fat and frankly the UK government need to crack down on products claiming to be &#34;Protein&#34; versions of a product that in most cases contain less than 20% protein. Examples of this are the multitudes of protein wraps wherein a single wrap contains 3g of protein, most bars like Trek bars which have double the fat content compared to protein among many many other. Recently i've seen sainsburys marketing a 1% fat &#34;Protein milk&#34; which is an example of a product that I feel has its place.

This should be promoted a lot more as many do not get enough fibre in their diet leading to hunger pangs and desires to eat increasing.

As someone who grew up below the poverty line and starved sometimes in my childhood, my upbringing was mired in eating peanut butter sandwiches, drinking whole milk and eating chocolate digestives or crisps rather than normal food that we could have afforded if my mum had known how to cook properly. Therefore, even now people living in a similar way may be a little ashamed if the labels were made too obvious.

If shops sold pre-seasoned chicken breasts for the same price or similar to non-seasoned versions it would save time for the consumer and provide healthier options when compared to burgers and the like sold in packets of 8 for £2.50. Thats a lot of calories to add into a daily diet and in my opinion is one of the reasons many gain so much weight. White meat requires work to improve the flavour, which is why birdseye products are popular to &#34;save time&#34;, seasoning bags to cook chicken in are also popular, however they're main ingredients are usually sugars. Simple marinades would hasten cooking for individuals and provide a chance to choose a healthier option. ",aed514a0-37bf-4fb8-8f76-840cd67cea48,08/08/2020 12:44

I exercise myself and I find this distinction easier to make but this should only be done for 'treat' food such as crisps, chocolate bars, ice cream etc. Our bodies need a certain amount of fats and carbohydrates to function and so this label shouldn't be used on every day items such as pasta where it could encourage people to develop unhealthy attitudes to food.

I say this since portion sizes are upto the manufacturer meaning they can make the figures look good on the packet since their portion size is tiny. Generally the issues are junk food which show unrealistic portion sizes. A 200g packet of sweets/chocolate should not have a portion size of 25g since no one is opening a packet of that size to eat 1/8th. If the system is going to be of use to most people, it needs to have realistic portion sizes based on what people actually eat and not what the manufacturer thinks you should eat.

On smaller packaging, could it be negotiated for it to be clearly labelled around the packet rather than on the front. This might provide some manufacturers with some leeway on small packaging items.  Other than that, I don't think much else should change. It will be a tough change for food manufacturers and of course we do not want food waste so I think I would ask for it to apply to products manufactured after a certain date so that existing stock can be sold as normal in stores.
